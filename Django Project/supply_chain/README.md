# The Supply Chain Management App

This app stores details of large commercial projects, in the construction sector. Examples
might include large-scale roadworks, new builds, or motorway works. Projects are usually 
posted by local Councils.

Projects are listed with their requirements. Contractors can then bid to be part of a team
of businesses working on a project.

For example, a large modification to a roundabout in the north of Leeds would require contractors
for excavation, traffic management, road surfacing, line painting, and more. There would also need
to be facilities such as toilets and catering. Every project would require a management company with
overall responsibility.
